APPENDIX B.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ OF THE PAULINE EPISTLES FOLLOWED
ΒΥ THEODORE.

THE following list of readings is the result of a comparison of the
Latin text of the Epistles printed in these volumes with the text of
R. Estienne’s folio Greek Testament (PariS, 1550), as edited by Dr
Scrivener (Cambridge, 1860).

An asterisk after an assumed reading indicates that it is reflected by
· one or more of the Latin versions ; a dagger‚ that the commentary
affords some reason for supposing that it found place in the Greek text
of Theodore. Variants which although suggested by the translator's
Latin receive no support from the commentam, and are almost or
altogether unknown to the MSS. and versions of the Greek Testament
and to the Greek patristic writerS‚ have been distinguished by a mark
of interrogation3 words omitted in the MSS. of our translation, but
probably represented in their archetype or in Theodore’s text, are
included in square bracketS. Where none of these marks has been
attached, it may generally be concluded that there is no sufficient
evidence to determine whether the reading is really Theodorean, or
is due to the caprice of the translator or to the accidents os transcrip-

tion. For particulars the reader is referred to the footnotes attached to
the commentary.

It will be found that when due allowance has been made for the
omissions os the commentator, the errors of the translator and his copyists‚
and the influence upon the translation of the Latin versions and indi·
reetly of the Western text, there remain but few readings in which the
textos Theodore can be shewn to have differed from that which was
followed by the other Antiochene fathers and by the later Greek writers
generally. Some os the exceptions however possess considerable inter-

est ; and two or three (e. g. the reading ὃς in 1 Tim. iii. 16), are of im-
portance to the textual critic.
