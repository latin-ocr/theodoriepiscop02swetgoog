3. oportet autem] Vulg„ “oportet

have been variously interpreted. (a) The

them scarcely needs a serious refutation.

whilst it is sreely granted, without regard
to moral character, in cases where both
marriagoe have preceded baptism. To
say nothing of the salse conception of
baptismal grace involved in this distinc-
tion, it is clear that such a practice (ι)
attacks the principle of successive poly-
gamy which S. Paul elsewhere sanctions
[Rom. vii. 3, 1 Cor. vii. 91, and (2) sails
to secure the object which he has here in
view, viz-2 the exclusion os unfit persons
from the patoral offi’ce. (b) Better, then,
is the explanation which sees in the
Apostle’s rule simply a rejection of all
candidates who have at any time practised
synchronous polygamy or concubinage‚
or have in any other way departed from
the strictness of matrimonial fidelity.’

illud quod quasi, δια] The translator
has scarcely comprehended his Greek.
Quasi represents δῆθεν, and is to be taken
with obseruatnr—‘the pretended observ·
ance of the Apostle’s rule.’
