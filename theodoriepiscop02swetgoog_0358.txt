FURTHER CITATIONS FROM THE LATIN THEODORE. 342

tells us that on one occasion Amalarius enjoyed the privilege of free
access to the books of the Imperial library¹; and it may have been there
that he formed an acquaintance with the Latin translation of T heodore.

Amalarius cites Ambrosiaster under the name of Ambrose on Rom.
xiv. 5 (Migne, P. L. 105, 1065), 1 Cor. iii. 6 (ib. 1012), xi. 8 (ib. 1104),
xi. 26 (ib. 1010), xii. 28 (ib. 1 119) ; and T heodore under the same name
on Phil. ii. 9 (Migne‚ '1oo9, 1225), 1 Tim. ii. 1² (ib. 987, 1175, 1242),
iii. 8 (ib. 1089, 1090), iii. 14 sq. (ib. 1084). Hence it appears probable
that in his codex of Ambrosius in epp. D. Pauli the commentary on
Romans and 1 Corinthians was entirely Ambrosiaster’S, and that that
on the Epistles from Philippians onwards was T heodore's; but there
is no evidence to shew whether his ‘Ambrose ’ = T heodore began with
PhilippianS, as in the MS. used by RabanuS, or with Galatiam, as in the
one from which Sedulius copied.

In the commentary on 1 Tim. ii., iii. I have been able to give the

⁰ variants from Amalarius under the text. The following are the only

peculiarities 1 have noted in the short extract from PhilippianS.
Ι. p. 222, l. 19 cognoscent, 20 quia (fir quoniam [1⁰]), 25 donatur Ι
illud (sor illurn). P. 22 3, l. 8 - dicit.

2. I have found extracts from our translation also in one of the
letters of RabanuS, the epistle addressed to Hincmar in reference
to the case of Gotteschalk (Migne. P. L. 112, 1518 sq.). This letter
was written in ΑΛ). 848, or at the earliest in 847, and is therefore later
than the commentaries on S. Paul. It contains a reference to Ambro-
siaster on Eph. i. 4, 5, and citations from ‘ Ambrose' = Theodore on
1 Tim. ii. 1 (cf. 11. pp. 86—88), 5—7 (ib. pp. 88—9o); Tit. iii. 10
(ib. p. 2 5 5)². The first two extracts were not discovered in time to
allow of the variants being incorporated in the body of the work. They,
are as follows: 11. p. 86, l. 12 -hominibus, 13 praecepit, 21 deguerint,
22 facientes· P. 87, l. 1 illis. P. 88, l. 5 deus (for dominus). P. 89,

¹ Histor- iii. α (Migne P. L. 141, 29):
“dedit ei imperator copiam librorum de
palatio suo ut ex ipsis ea quae uiderentur
congrua excuperet.” This was after the
synod of 816, and the immediate result
of Amalarius's labours was the Regula
canonicorum which is printed in Migne
(P. L. 105, 815 sq.)

² Amalarius is much perplexed by the
order of the synonyms in 1 Tim. ii. 1,
as they appear in the translation of Theo·
dore3 and hythe divergence of the defini-

tions offered by ‘ Ambrose’ from those
which find place in S. Augustine (Ep.
149). But the departure of the text from
the order of the Latin versions does not
seem to have suggested any doubt as to
the genuineness of the work. The age
was ready to accept without enquiry any·
thing which bore the name of one of the
greater fathers.

³ Hincmar himself cites Ambrosiaster
as Ambrose on 1 Tim. (Migne P. L. ¹²5·

3²0)-
