IN EPISTOLAM B. PAULI
AD THESSALONICENSES ΙΙ.

ARGUMENTUM.

BEATUS apostolus PauluS, postquam primam ad Thessalo-
nicenses scripserat epistolam, cognouit quod quamquam aduer-
sariorum pertinacia in eadem perstiterit saeuitia, uariis tempta-
tionibus adgressa eos qui crediderant, tamen ad omnia illa aspera
quae isdem fuerant [inlata‚ uirtute] Dei in fide persistenteS,
superiores omni temptatione fuerint demonstrati. cognouit
uero quod a· quibusdam suasi aestiment finem praesenti in-
cumbere saecu10, hocque aliqui quasi ab ipso apostolo edocti

2. cognouit quod, δια] ‘This second dore’s (cs. 11. p. 2, 1. 13, note).
Epistle was written in consequence os 5. ficerunt [inlata‚ uirtute] Dei, δια]
information received aster the despatch The lacuna in the MSS. (see vv. 11.. and

of the first. The Apostle (1)commends
and encourages the saith os the majority,
os which he had received a favourable
report [c. i]; (α) guards against the error
os supposing the Second Advent to be
imminent, reminding the Thessalonians
that it must be preceded by the revela-
tion of the Antichrist [c. ii]; (3) ad·
ministers a rebuke to the indolent and
disorderly brethren who had refused to
profit by bis advice' [c. iii].—Thdt.’s
argument again closely resembles Theo-

the sacsimile opp. to 1. p. xxiv.) is, at least
in H, where it occupies the end os a line
and the beginning os the next, sufficient
for two words os sully average length.
1 have admitted the very probable con-
jecture of the Corbie corrector (cf. infra,
pp. 42, l. 8, 44, l. 7, 48, 1. 3), and have
added, but with less confidence‚ uirtute
:rii δυνάμει. Possibly a whole line has
been lost, and the letters di or de re·
present the last syllable of an adjective
or adverb.
