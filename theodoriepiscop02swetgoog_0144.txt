orders, but he gives no reference to
ancient authorities. According to the

later Greek rituai the subdeacon is or-
dained ἐπὶ τῆς ὡραίας πύλης (Daniel, cod.
liturg. iv. fasc( 2, p. 5503 cf. Neale,
His-t. ΗΕ. ck. 1. p. 198, Dict. qs Chr.
Ant. 1. p. 573), whilst the deacon is led
είς τὸ ἅγιον βῆμα (Daniel, p. 55 α).

· ι. alii quidem, alii uero] ‘ The read·
ers and subdeacons respectively’; below
(p. 134, ll. 1, α), ‘the presbyters and
deacons.'

α. intra diaconarum] See vv. ll.
On the diaconicum or diaconium (Du-
cange, sm.) ef. Neale, H. E. Ch. 1. p.
¹9¹ 3 Βία. qs Chr. Ant„ s. v. The Greek
shews that whether τοῦ διακονικοῦ stood in
the original or not, Amalarius is right in
reading intra. The Co. os Laodicea had
indeed expressly forbidden the subdeacon
to take his place in the diacone'cum (can.
21: ὅτι οὐ δεῖ ὑπηρέτας ἔχειν χώραν ἐν τῷ
διακονικῷ καὶ ἅπτεσθαι δεσποτικῶν σκευῶν)
-a prohibition afterwards adopted in the
West by the Co. of Agde (ΑΛ). 506,
can. 66: ‘⁸ non oportet insacratos minis·
tros licentiam habere in secretarium,
quod Graeci διακονικόν adpellant, in·
gredi, et contingere uasa dominica'’).
But is these restrictions were more than
local and temporary, they must have had
reference merely to the ceremonial hand·
ling of the. vessels, and to the use of the
Actaeona-um at the time os the Celebra-
tion‚ since the office of the subdeacon

cum H infra diaconum r intra diaconium a

required him at other times to enter the
place where the vessels were kept and to
prepare these and the other requisites of
Divine Service sor the deacon’s use; cf.
Balsamon's note on the Laodiceae Canon
(Migne, P. G. 137, 13⁶9)² μηδὲ γὰρ
εἴπῃς μὴ ὀφείλειν τούτους ἅπτεσθαι τῶν
ίερῶν σκενῶν...κενὼ“ν ὄντων· αὐτοῖς ’γὰρ
μᾶλλον οἰκεία ἐστὶν ἡ τούτων ὑπηρεσία.
This was in fact implied in the form of his
ordination3 cf. A post. Const. viii. τι
(πρὸς τὸ ἐπαξίως ἐφάπτεσθαι τῶν λειτουρ·
γικῶν σου σκευῶν), Conc. Carthag. iv.
can. 5 (“patenam de episcopi manu ac-
cipiat uacuam et calicem uacuum ³³). But
the subdeacon’s handling of the paten
and chalice was merely intra diaconicum,
it was no function os his to convey them
to the attan cf. Amal. ii. 11: “sub-
diaconus uasa altaris ad eum [τ’. q. diaco-
num] desert, ipse uero ad altare.’' Comp.
Hesele 11. p. 313.

3. necnon luminariorum] This is
not mentioned among the duties os the
subdeacon as enumerated by the ancient
authorities. But the Greek office sor his
ordination contains the petition: δὸς αὐτῷ
...ἀνάπτειν λύχνον σκηνώματος δόξης σου.
See Daniel, l.c.‚ who notes (from Goar)
that among the Maronites the newly-
ordained subdeacon perambulates the
Church, and when he comes to the can·
delubrum thrice extinguishes it and lights

it again—a symbol, apparently, of this
part os his official work. ’
