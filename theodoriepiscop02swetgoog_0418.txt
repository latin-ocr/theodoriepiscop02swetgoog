BEDA'S ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, BOOKS

111„ IV.. the Text from the very ancient MS. in the Cambridge University
Library, collated with six other MSS. Edited, with a lise from the German of
Enmt‘r, and with Notes, dte. by J. E. Β. Muto& M.A., Professor of Latim
and J. R. Lumn', D.D., Norrisian Professor os Divinity. Revised edition.

“To your71 students os English History the illustrative notes will be os t service, while
the study of t e texts will be a good introduction to Media-‚val Latin.’'— The onconfhmist.

“In Bede's works Englishmen can go back to on· ⁸ s of their history, unequalled sor
form and matter by any modern European nation. Prol. Mayor has done good service in ren·
dering a part of Bede's greatest work accessible to those who can read Latin with ease. He
has adorned this edition of the third and fourth books os the ⁸⁸ Ecclesiastical Histo '⁹ with that
amazing erudition sor which he is unrivalled among Englishmen and rarely equalled y Germans.
And however interesting and valuable the text may be, we can certainly appl to his notes
the e ression, La sance vau! ,κατα que Ie pozkson. They are literally cramme with interest·
in iifssrmation about earl English lise. For though eeclesiasticnl in name, Bede’s history treats
o all parte of the nati life, since the Church bad points os contact with auf-Examina.
