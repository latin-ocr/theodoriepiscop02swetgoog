rebus indubiam probationem. unde et adicit :

qui manifestatus est in carne.

hoc est, ‘ pietatis delector mysterio eo quod sit magnum et
supereminens; quoniam is qui inuisibilis est Deus Verbum, Uni-
genitus Patris, manifestauit se hominibuS, in carne adparens pro

communi omniurn salute.’

1. Ιι. e., indubium] Chrys-2 ‘

3. qui manifestatus est] Both our MSS.
read qui, here and below (p. 136, l. 7),
and use the masc. consistently throughout
the context3 and even Rab„ who in the
text has substituted ‘⁴ quod manifestum ”
[a fusion, perhaps os the Vulg. “quod
manifestatum '' with the reading os C]‚
betrays his author’s text by retaining qui
in the comm. (p. 136,1. 7). and by leaving
adsumptus (p. 138,1. 17) unchanged. Thus
the present translation goes to confirm
the inserence already drawn from the Gk.
fragm. of Th. de incarn. xiii. (Migne,
P. G. 66, 987), tlmt Th. read ἃς ἐφανερώθη.
At the same time too much weight must
not be attached in this. instance to our
translator’s testimony, since he may have
been influenced in favour of qui by Je-
rome's authority [on Isa- liii. 11, “qui
apparuit in carne;” but whether as an
exact quotation is open to doubt]‚ or by
local and contemporary usage3 qui is the
reading os Liberatus bre-u. 19 [cf. Tisch.
ad Ιι. l.]‚ os whom see 1. p. lv.

If Th. read ὅς, he was in harmony

with the Syriae versions (Scrivener, In-
trod. p. 555), but differed from both

sent texts os their commentaries are cor-

as regards Chrys., whose comm. asquoted

that word occurs in the catenist‘s own.
text, and (2) agrees as well with the read·
ing ὅς οι· ὅ as with θοός. Nor is Thdt.’s
exposition decisive in favour os θεός either

to quote the passage in the form θεὸς

p. 26¹, l. 18, note; and Thdt. ad lul.
(ἀόρατον ἔχων τὴν φύσει δῆλος ἅπασιν
ἑιανθρωτήσας ἐγένετο) and Eranist. lec.
(ἀόρατος μὲν ἡ θεία, φύσις, ὁρατὴ δὲ ἡ

Comp. Th. on S. John i. 14: ἰδίωμα δὲ
τῆς ’γραφῆς ἀπὸ τῆς σαρκὸς τὸν ὅλον

point out that the use οἰσάρξ in reference
to the homo susceptus is a protest against
docetic error, not a concession to Apolli·
narianisrn.
