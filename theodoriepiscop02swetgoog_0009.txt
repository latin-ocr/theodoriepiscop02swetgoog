vi PREFACE.

My acknowledgements are again due to Μι- Bensly, for having
revised the Syriae quotations in the notes and Appendices; to
the officers and workmen os the University Press, for· their
continued endeavours to bring the letter-press to perfection;
· and to the Syndics of the PreSS, sor the patience with which
they have borne the many delays incident to the execution
of my task.

For myself‚ the work which has occupied the leisure- of
the last seven years will have its full reward, if this edition
of one of the most remarkable of ancient commentaries shall

be permitted to lighten in any way the toil os those who are

engaged in the higher labour os editing and interpreting the
Epistles os S. Paul.
