et tertiam, quod non caute de eo possent conicere eo quod
incertum est an in proposito meliore persistat necne ad antiqua
recurrens sui deterior existat, sed studio meliorum inlustretur.
haec quidem dicta sunt a Paulo qua a uiro diuina credito gratia
sdici debuerant. hi uero qui Pauli decretis superiores se esse
existimant, nihil horum perpendere uolunt, sed plurimos in
episcopatum producunt nec uitam eorum antiquam nec pro-
positum examinare suadenteS, sed ad defensionem suam hoc solum
proferunt, quod aut nuper crediderit aut nuper sit baptizatus,

ob quas non sic fieri oportere Paulus instruxit, et tunc perspiciet -

recent date of the candidate‘s conversion
or baptism was made an excuse for his
inability to produce proofs ot his fitness
for the episcopal office; whereaS, accord-
ing to S. Paul, it should have precluded
his ordination altogether.

13. examinet, δια] The drift of this
confused passage seems to be as fol-
lows: ‘Three resultS, S. Paul foretells‚
will follow the promotion of a neophyte3
he will be (ι) elated by spiritual pride,
(α) exposed to the reproaches of non-
Christians who remember his former life,
(3) liable to fall back into his old sins.
One or more of these anticipations may
be said to have been realized in all cases
where S. Paul’s rule has been disobeyed.
Prelates so ordained have invariably
proved to be proud or greedy os gain, or
at least have failed to command the respect

of the outer world.’

This appeal to facts is certainly not
borne out by the chief recorded instances
of departure from the Apostolic precept.
The Western Church had few greater

· lights than SS. Cyprian and Ambrose;

and in the East Nectarius of Constanti-
nople and Eusebius os Cappadocian Cae-
sarea reflected no dishonour upon the
Episcopate. But these cases, notably
the first tw0, were exceptional (cf. the
79th Apostolical Canon: el μήπου κατι),
θείαν χάριν τοῦτο fluerat—add S. Basil.
ep. 217); if the precedent was largely
followed, as it seems to have been in Th.’s
age and neigbourhood, results such ashe
describes would certainly have been like-
ly to follow. The warmth of his language
seems to shew that he had himself ex-
perienced the inconvenience of such
irregular consecrations.
