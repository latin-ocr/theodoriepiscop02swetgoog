statement in l. 8 sq. Either hanc should
be replaced by illam (i.q. primam); or
the sentence needs readjustment, and
should have been written and punctuated
thus: “scribit...ex urbe Roma, in illo
tempore etenim quando...fuerat ductus,
duobus annis tunc,” &c. The catena sup-
ports the latter view. The former, which
is perhaps the simplet and more probable
correction, has the effect of crediting Th.
with the theory that r Tim. was written
from Rome before the end of the first
imprisonment. This is perhaps not al-
together impossible, notwithstanding
Timothy’s presence with S. Paul during
the greater part of the διετία (cf. Phil. i. 1.
Col. i. 1. Philem. 1 ς Bp. Lightfoot,
Philtppians, p. 11, note r); for the Ap.
intended to send him to Philippi (Phil. ii.
23), and from thence he might have re-
turned to Ephesus, where, as Th. seems
elsewhere to suppose (1. p. 116, 1. 5 sq.),
he had been lest in charge upon S. Paul's·
withdrawal from that city. In this case
the first Epistle was addressed to Timothy
on occasion of his resuming his work at
Ephesus, after his visit to Rome and
towards the end of S. Paul’s two years’
imprisonment. If this was Th.'s view, he

dates the Ep. from Rome, and that with·
out note of time (Tisch.⁸, p. 865).

1. Felicem adpellans] Cf. 1. p. 116,
l. 16, note. Felicem is probably due to a
slip on the part of Th. himself ; he meant
to write κατὰ τοῦ Φήστου.

6. percamus e. orbem tetrae] During
the interval he had visited Corinth, Miletus
(2 Tim. iv. το), Troas (α Tim. iv. 13),
probably also Nicopolis (Tit. iii. 15);
westwuda his journeyings had extended
to Spain and perhaps even further (Rom.
xv. 24, 283 Clem. R. 1 Cor. 53 Can.
Mutat. (ed. Tregelles‚ p. 19). Cf. Euseb.
ii. ἠε ἀπολογησάμενον αὖθις ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ
κηρύγματος διακονίαν λόγος ἔχει crel-
λασθαι τᾶν ἀπόστολον. Hier. de virr. ill. 5
(Migne P. L. 2 3, 615)= “ sciendum autem
in prima satisfactione...Paulum a Nerone
dimissum ut euangelium Christi in occi·
dentis quoque partibus praedicaretur. ''
