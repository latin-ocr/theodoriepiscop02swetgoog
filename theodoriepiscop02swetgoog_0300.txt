APPENDIX' A.

FRAGMENTS OF THE DOGMATIC WORKS
OF THEODORE.

IN the notes to this edition 1 have had frequent occasion to refer
the reader to extant fragments of the lost works of Theodore; and where
any of these supplied an important illustration os his commentary on S.
Paul, it has been quoted, sometimes at length. Since the completion of
the first volume, and when the second was already far advanced‚ a
German critic¹, to whose views on this subject great deference is due,
expressed a wish that room might be found in this edition for a reissue
of the fragments as a whole. To have collected and re-edited the entire
mass would have swelled the second volume to an inordinate size‚
besides requiring an expenditure of time and labour ,for which 1 was not
prepared; and under the circumstances it has been determined to
reproduce only the fragments of the dogmatic works, leaving to some
,future editor the reissue (if it should be thought necessary) of the
fragmentary commentaries on the Old Testament. To all that survives
of the lost commentaries on the New Testament, the work of Ο. F.
F ritzsche is still a sufficient and accessible guide.

The greater number of the fragments which follow have already been
collected by the Abbe Migne (patrol. Graeca, lxvi. 966—1020)⁸. In

¹ Dr Jacobi in the Gb'ttingisckc gelehrte collection in the Analecta Sm'aca of
Anzeigen sor 21-28 Sept. 1881: “wir Ρ. de Lagarde (Lips., 1858) and the
konnen den dringenden Wunsch nicht Theodori Mops. fragmenta &trunca edited

unterdriicken, dass es Herrn Sw. und
dem Verleger gesallen moge die ander-
weitig herausgegebenen kleineren Stiicke
mit dem zweiten Theile zu verbinden.”
In a private letter Dr J. had previously
suggested a reprint of the fragments pre-
served in the Latin of Marius Mercator.
¹ There are important additions to this

S. 11.

by E. Sachau (Lips., 1869). But as these
books are inexpensive and mn easily be
procured, 1 have contented myself with
an occasional reference to them. One
Syriae fragment only hm been in part
reprinted, where it serves to fill up a gap
in the extant Greek.
