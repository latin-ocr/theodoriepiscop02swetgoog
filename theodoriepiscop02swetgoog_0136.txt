vinces undoubtedly contained for the most up to the fifth century, contained but few
part more than three or even four παροι- dioceses3 e.g. it seems that Belgica 1.

κίαι each ; cf. Cone. Nicaen. can. 4: ἐπί-
σκοπον προσήκει μάλιστα μὲν ὑπὸ πάντων
τῶν ἐν τῇ ἐπαρχίᾳ καθίστασθαι· εί δὲ δυσ-
χερὲς εἴη τὸ τοιοῦτο, &ducturos τρεῖς...
συμψήφων ὄντων τῶν ἁπάντων,
κ.τ.λ. Th. is however doubtless right in
asserting that the Episcopate did not sud·
denly reach its sull strength, but grew by
a gradual subdivision of the provincial
ChurcheS. Thus S. Timothy was lest by
S. Paul in sole charge of proconsular
Asia3 but in the age os S. Ignatius there
were already two Bishops in that province
(Lightfoot, Phil„ p. 210), and by the
middle of the second century, as it would
seem, two more sees had been added (ib.
p. ἰι 1). If the Angels os Apoc. i—iii.
are to be identified with the presiding
bishops, this increase had begun in the

lifetime of S. John, since Pergamus be· ·

,longed to the province os which Ephesus
was the metropolis.

1. in panibus occiduis, δια] Has this
statement any historieal foundation? No
doubt some of the European provinces,

and Germania 1. had but four each,
the province of Alpes Graiae claimed
but three, Germania 11. but two, whilst
Scythia remained even in Th.‘s time un·
divided (Bingham, ΙΧ. c. vi. Wiltsch, 1.
p. 184 sq. [E. T.]). An imperfect know·
ledge of these facts may have led our
author to attribute to the general usage
os the West a state os things which was
in fact merely accidental and partiaL

Gk.). Of promouere intrans. the lexx.
furnish no example.

sai et per singula loca, δια] See
the Dict. of Chr. Ant. 11. p. 14803 and
with regard to the chorepiscopi, cf. supra,
p. 123, l. 4, note. Probably the appre-
hension expressed at Sardica (ἵνα μή
κατευτελίζηται τὸ τοῦ ἐπισκόπου ὄνομα καὶ
ἦ nooman) was well founded, and was
entertained, amongst others, by Th. him-
sels.
