THEODORUS MOPSUESTENUS

[v. 9.

illam legem quae naturae posita est ille qui se pietatem seruare
promittit custodire noluerit. incipiens uero docere ab illo loco quo
dixit uiduas honora quae uere uiduae sunt, quales conueniat esse
illas quae sub ecclesiasticorum diligentia habentur, interposuit de

ad quos hoc reddidit,

implens illud quod in superioribus minus dixerat; deinde ad
suam recurrens sequentiam, manifeste exponit quales uult esse
uiduas quae et sub regula ecclesiastica et prouidentia debent

haberi, dicens :

uidua eligatur non minus annorum sexaginta.

ante omnia aetatem designandam esse credidit in qua con-.
stitutae debent in ordinem recipi uiduarum. quidam uero non
considerantes quam ob causam aetatem uoluerit significari, hoc

same effect.

6. ad suam recurrent seq.] After
the break of v. 4-8, the Ap. now pro·
ceeds to point out who are the ὅντως
χῆραι of v. 3, and how they are to bc
‘honoured.’ Cf. Lanfranc.

ιι. ante omnia aetatem] Thpht.: καὶ
πρῶτον μὲν περὶ τῆς ἡλικίας ἀκριβο·

ια. quidam uero, δια] ‘Theyare in error
who found upon this verse any mle as to
the proper age for admission into the order
of deaconesses. For (1) S. Paul cannot
have intended to require in female candi·
dates for the diaconate a higher age than
he required in candidates for the priest-
hood and episcopatu nor (α) could the
fixing of so advanced a period os lise have
been necessary as a test of moral fitness.
'His precept refers only to the widows
«who were to be enrolled as Church pen-
sioners; it was requisite that such should
have (1) reached an age when they were
unable wholly to support themselves,
and (α) proved themselves worthy to
receive the Church’s charity.’

Th. possibly refers to the edict of

Theodosius (xvi. tit. α. i. ²73 cs. Sozom.
H. E. vu. 16): “nulla nisi emensis Lx·
annis...secundum praeceptum apostoli ad
diaconissarum consortium transferatur.''
This confusion of the two distinct orders
of widows and deaconesses finds place
also in Pelagius, who remarks ad Ιι. Lx
“tales uoluit elegi diaconissas quae om-
nibus essent exemplum uiuendi.‘' It is
worth noticing that whilst primasius
simply repeats PelagiuS, Sedulius adds
Th.'s view as an alternative: “elignwr,
in ministerium diaconatus; uel ut sus-
tentatur opibus ecclesiae.”

In earlier Church literature the order
of ‘widows’ appears as a distinct body
(m‘duatus, Tert. de uirg. uel. 93 ordo
nidum-um, Ps.-Clem. Recogn. vl. 15; τὸ
τάγμα τῶν χηρῶν Ps.·1gn. Philipp. 15 [cs.
Igu. Smyrn. 13 (τὰς παρθένους τὰς λεγο-
μένας χήρας), and Zahn’s note ad Ι.];
and the distinction was at a later time
quite clearly recognized by the Quinisext
Co. (can. 40: ἐν ’γὰρ τῷ θείῳ armam,
γέγραπται ἑξήκοντα ἐτῶν τὴν ἐν τῇ ἐκκλη-
σίᾳ καταλέγεσθαι χήραν· 01 δὲ ἱεροὶ
κανόνες τεσσαράκοντα ἐτῶν τὴν διακόνισσαν
χειροτονεῖσθαι παραδεδώκασιν).
